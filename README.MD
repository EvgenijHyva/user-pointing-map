### Instructions for running project:

1. Backend -> [Link to Backend README](geobackend/README.MD)

2. Frontend -> [Link to Frontend README](frontend/README.md)

### OR you just can run docker-compose file it will do everything for you:

This will create 2 containers with DB and geobackend instance.

Before execution read [Link to Backend README](geobackend/README.MD) about .env file

```bash
# requires .env in backend folder on same level with settings file
docker-compose up --build
# or just
docker-compose up

Sometimes you need to restart docker compose, because on initial state it try to run skripts against database and fail. After restart it should working.

- 403 Forbiden ( while creating/updating/deleting points <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> ) -> Clear Browser Cookies and Cache. In your web browser settings, clear your cookies, cache, and browsing history. Close and reopen your browser.
- Backend Docker / Docker Compose Issue: This issue likely stems from challenges with GDAL and GEOS paths within the container. This project was originally developed on Windows ( <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> ) with WSL, and on Mac (üçè), Docker uses a different builder, which may introduce variations in the environment.
